# Description
This is a collection of snippets that help me in my daily workflow, but don't warrant entire gems/packages.

Consider it a library of useful utilities.

# Directory structure:

* bin
 * This directory contains all the scripts themselves.  This is just so README.md and other files don't show up in PATH.

# Gemfile:

The Gemfile here isn't split up per package, it is just a home for the various components so I can run bundle on new hosts and get what I need.
